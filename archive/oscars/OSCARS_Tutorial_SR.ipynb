    "# OSCARS Tutorial for the SR Module\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a brief getting started tutorial for the oscars.sr module.  The oscars.sr module is for computing quantaties related to the radiative properties of charged particles in motion.  It is concerned with *REAL* field data for magnetic and electric fields.  At its root it is a discritization of the field equations which are derived from the Liénard–Wiechert potentials.  It is valid in the near-field and for relativistic and non-relativistic particles alike.\n",

    "In addition to the oscars.sr module there exists an oscars.th module which deals more with theoretical analytical results for bending magnets, undulators, wigglers, spectra, flux, and brightness.\n",
