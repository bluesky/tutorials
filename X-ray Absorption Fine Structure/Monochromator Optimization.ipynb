    "# Monochromator Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use a custom plan that is tuned to a specific, common task at an XAFS (X-ray Absorbance Fine Structure) beamline.\n",
    "* This plan will take some readings, do some prompt analysis on those readings, and then immediately take an action based on the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Science Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a schematic of a double crystal monochromator (DCM), like the one at NSLS-II's BMM (Beamline for Materials Measurement) and many other beamlines.  The broadband radiation from the 3-pole wiggler source is incident upon the first crystal of the DCM.  At BMM, we most often use a Si(111) DCM and have the option to use Si(311) crystals.  The schematic below applies equally well to either crystal type and to any other crystal monochrmoator, as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first crystal monochromates the X-ray beam by Bragg diffraction. The crystal is on a high-preceision rotation stage and the angle between the incident beam and the lattice planes of the crystal is chosen so that a specific wavelength meets the Bragg condition, $\\lambda = 2d\\sin(\\Theta)$, where $d$ is the spacing between the lattice planes of the crystal and $\\Theta$ is the angle between the incident beam and the lattice planes of the first crystal.  By changing the angle, we change the wavelength of the beam diffracting from the first crystal.  Because there is a simple relationship between wavelength and energy, we select X-ray energy by changing the angle of the first crystal.\n",
    "\n",
    "![DCM](./static/doubleb.gif)  [(image source)](http://pd.chem.ucl.ac.uk/pdnn/inst2/condit.htm)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second crystal of the DCM is used to direct the beam downstream, towards the experimental hutch.  The second crystal needs to be at the same angle as the first crystal in order to meet the Bragg condition for the wavelength selected by the first crystal.  In order to pass the X-rays with high efficiency through the DCM, the first and second crystals must be parallel, within microradians. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we make a large change in energy -- for example, when moving between elements with absorption edge energies that are very far apart -- it is prudent to verify that this difference in angle is small.  This is done by making a scan of the pitch of the second crustal, monitoring the intensity of the X-ray beam in the experimental hutch. When the second crystal is perfectly parallel to the first crystal, the intensity of the X-rays passing the the onochromator is maximized.  Thus this pitch scan of the second crystal will be a peaked function.  We want to place the second crystal pitch at the maximum of this peak.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Running a beamline\n",
    "\n",
    "BlueSky provides all the tools we need to perform this optimization.  Here's the game plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perform a scan of the pitch motor over a range that will include the optimal pitch position\n",
    "2. Record an intensity signal from a detector downstream of the DCM\n",
    "3. When the scan is finished, analyze the intensity measurements and determine the position of peak intensity\n",
    "4. Move the second crystal pitch motor to its optimized position\n",
    "\n",
    "BlueSky has you covered.  It comes with scan plans that perfom steps 1 and 2.  Step 3 is readily implemented using tools from Numerical and Scientific Python.  Step 4 is handled by one of BlueSky's standard motor motion commands.  None of this is difficult ... *except* that you need to know some things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The name of the motor to be scanned\n",
    "* The name of the detector to be monitored\n",
    "* The syntax of the mathematical tools used to analyze the measured data\n",
    "* The names of the standard plans for scanning and moving motors\n",
    "\n",
    "For the beamline staff, those things should be common knowledge.  For a general user or a new post-doc, those things are esoteric mysteries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a user to remember the names of everything and the sequence of commands to run in order to perform this scan is certainly possible, but certainly  challanging. At an XAFS beamline, this optimization might be needed dozens of times each day -- and it **must** be done correctly *every single time*. Even a modestly complicated procedure like this optimization becomes a serious friction point in the use of the beamline.\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution to this friction is make a bespoke measurement plan, tailored to the beamline and constructed from the basic plans provided by BlueSky.  That is, we make a plan that performs all the steps of this optimization chore.  Thus, instead of training the general user or new post-doc the steps of the optimization, you simply have to train them to run this one plan when it is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the XAFS community, we usually call this monochromator optimization a \"rocking curve scan\".  (We are \"rocking\" the second crystal through its optimal position and measuring the resulting peak-shaped curve.)  The `rocking_curve()` plan explained below is used reliably everyday by users and staff at BMM.\n",

    "In truth, the rocking curve plan is rarely called directly either by staff or by users at BMM.  It is, nonetheless, used many times each day.  At BMM, we have a plan called `change_edge()` that is used to automate the reconfiguration of the beamline for measurements in different energy ranges.  This plan is how the staff and users typically perform the rocking curve chore.\n",

    "2. performs a rocking curve scan just like the one in this tutorial\n",
    "3. optimizes the position of the beam-definition slits\n",
    "4. makes sure detectors are properly configured to make measurements at the chosen absorption edge\n",
    "\n",
    "leaving the beamline completely optimized for measurement at the selected absorption edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason such a magical plan is possible is because, in BlueSky, plans are composed of plans.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Just as the rocking curve plan is built from basic plans (specifically the `rel_scan()` and `mv()` plans), complex user-defined plans are composed of simpler user-defined plans.  At BMM, we have plans for each item `change_edge()` chore list.  Thus, the `change_edge()` plan is composed of these smaller plans such as `rocking_curve()`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By building complicated plans out of well-tested, single-purpose plans, we are able to perform automation at the beamline in ways that make the beamline easy to operate for staff and users alike.  In fact, at BMM, we allow *and* encourage our users to run the `change_edge()` command all by themselves!\n"
