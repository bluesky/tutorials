    "We want to understand how to build a *Flyer* in \"Bluesky\" to support various types of fly scans and remote data loggers.  The data about Flyers is spread about the standard documentation.  We need some clarity and a few examples that build complexity incrementally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic notion of a Flyer is that it directs an *external controller* (we'll call it the *controller* here) to perform some data collection process.  Usually, a *controller* is used to collect data at rates beyond the capabilities of Bluesky plans and the RunEngine.  Examples could be waveforms from a storage oscilloscope or a continuous motion scan of a diffractometer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show the basic requirements for a Flyer and build a simple working example you can use a template for your own work.  (Our inspiration to create this [basic flyer tutorial](https://github.com/prjemian/ipython_mintvm/issues/3#issuecomment-385058577) was the goal of operating various fly scans at the APS, such as the [USAXS fly scan](https://github.com/APS-USAXS/ipython-usaxs/issues/3), from Bluesky.  The examples we found before we started this project quickly became too instrument-specific to serve as tutorials.)\n",

    "\n",
    "In Bluesky, a [Flyer](http://nsls-ii.github.io/bluesky/async.html?highlight=flyer#flying) is an [`ophyd.Device`](http://nsls-ii.github.io/ophyd/device-overview.html) that meets the [Fly-able interface](http://nsls-ii.github.io/ophyd/architecture.html#fly-able-interface), which has three methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Kickoff - begin accumulating data\n",
    "1. Complete - Bluesky tells the Flyer that Bluesky is ready to receive data\n",
    "1. Collect - the device provides the data to Bluesky\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two methods [must return](http://nsls-ii.github.io/bluesky/hardware.html#kickoff) an instance of [`ophyd.status.Status`](http://nsls-ii.github.io/ophyd/generated/ophyd.status.Status.html) (a.k.a. a *status* object).  For our code, we choose a specialized version of `Status()`, the [`DeviceStatus()`](http://nsls-ii.github.io/ophyd/generated/ophyd.status.DeviceStatus.html) object, based on the [explanation provided in discussion](https://github.com/NSLS-II/tutorial-docker/pull/7#discussion_r185054364).\n",

    "The `collect()` method requires a companion `describe_collect()` that informs the RunEngine what kind of data to expect from `collect()`.

    "The `BareMinimumFlyer` is a good start to use a Flyer but we'll need to add a few more things to make a good template.  The first thing to do is to make the status objects known to any method of the class.  We'll prepend both of them with `self.` and describe in the code comments what is happening.  In the constructor (`__init__()`), we set both to `None`, the value we expect when not kicked off or *flying*, respectively.  Since we **need** a constructor, we must remember to call the constructor of the superclass as well or our `ophyd.Device` will not work correctly.\n",

We can do that either by polling the PV or by subscribing to a callback on the completion event.  We'll make that choice when we implement the actual activity.  Here, intend to wait in a polling loop.  Since the polling loop is an activity that does not return until the *controller* is done, we must do that waiting in a thread (consider an [alternative suggestion to use `epics.ca.CAThread`](https://github.com/NSLS-II/tutorial-docker/pull/7#discussion_r184905960)) separate from that of the RunEngine.  (We do not want to block the RunEngine thread so it is free to respond to other activities, such as data from other streams or the user inerface.)  So, we run `my_activity()` in a separate thread that is called from `kickoff()`:\n",
